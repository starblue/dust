# `dust`

> A collection of crates for running Rust on microcontrollers.

## About

Currently supports parts of NXP LPC8xx, LPC11xx and LPC13xx.

Supported peripherals are SYSCON, GPIO, UART, partly IOCON, LPC804 PLU.

## Warning

This is work in progress and things may change without prior notice.
At least initially I want to use it for developing and testing ideas
how to use Rust to program microcontrollers in the nicest possible
way, which may mean some combination of most modular, most efficient,
safest, easiest, or any number of other desirable qualities.

## Thanks

To japaric for pushing embedded Rust, and providing examples how
things can be made to work.
